Hello! This repository contains XMPP-client(Jabber).

Primary goal of this project is to create chat-bot for monitoring chat-room and for greeting "Hello %username%!" when anybody says: "Good morning, colleagues!". Second goal is sending messages in chat-room with useful information such as weather, RSS, exchange rates.

Currently done:

- connection to XMPP-server;
- sending messages functionality ;
- main form design;
- RSS-feed collector ;
So, if you are intrested in this project, create new branch, update the code, come up with new ideas! :)

Best regards, Aleynikov Maxim.
